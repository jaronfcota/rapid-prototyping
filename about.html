# About Me

I'm Jaron Cota, a third-year student at MIT studying Nuclear Engineering (Course 22) and Physics (Course 8).
I'm interested in sustainability, nuclear fusion technology, and helping reverse the climate catastrophe. 
I have some experience researching at MIT with the UROP program, and am currently working on a publication.
Other non-academic interests of mine are playing video games, reading, running, biking, and music.
