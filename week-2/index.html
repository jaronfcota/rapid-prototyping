## Week 2
<br>

### Brainstorming

Initial brainstorming done as a whole class:

* Clients/Stakeholders 
  * MIT students
  * Campers
  * Government (local/natural)
  * Non-profits 
  * Residential building
  * Small business 


* Audience
  * Online presence
  * Housing displaced
  * Students on campus or specific department
  * City of Cambridge residents


* Energy Sources
  * Solar 
  * Wind/Pressure difference 
    * Natural of Manmade
  * Rain 
  * Geothermal
	* Temperature difference (like waste heat or other)
  * Composte 
  * Kinetic energy (like people or things moving) 
  * Hydro
	

* Capture/Energy Storage 
  * Compress air
  * Water wheel
  * Tidal energy 
  * Waste heat 
  * DC voltage 
  * Battery 
  * Material phase change 
	* Like molten salt or tanks of hot water, something along those lines
  * Water tower
  * Braking 
  * Flywheel 
  * Gyros  
  * Evaporative cooling 


* Project Ideas 
  * Rechargable handwarmers
  * Cabin heated by compost 
  * Wheel/rain capture 
	* Runoff capture centered around drains 
	* Could have contraption to charge phone 
  * Solar concentrator pavilion 
	* Cook things 
  * Science demonstration 
	* Didactic sculpture 
  * Emboddied energy 
  * Solar/wind powered bike
	* or maybe a motorized attachment 
  * Gravitational potential energy demonstration/sculpture 
  * Boiling water pollution/purification 
	* Mobile espresso machine 
  * "Climate Change" room(s) 
  * Perpetual motion machines 
  * Spinning loop powering light
  * Wind/solar/whatever-powered compressed air station 
    * Pneumatic systems could be created from it 

### Precedent Research
<br>

#### Compost heater

There is already some research done into this (see [this wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compost_heater)).
Apparently it could be a pretty good heat generator. 

#### Renewable air compressor

Use wind/solar to compress air that may be released to either fill tires or integrate into pneumatic systems or other things you can do with compressed air.
Maybe could lead to the greater purpose of creating creative pneumatic systems, some real steampunk stuff.
