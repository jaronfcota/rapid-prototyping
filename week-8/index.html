## Week 8
<br>

#### Continued Machining and Prototyping 

Work was done on the aluminum block; a single groove was milled into it. More refinement is needed to get a reasonable groove. 



<br>

#### Design Integration Meeting 

Discussion of the collection mechanism. 

* Design Integration 
	* Thinking of how to attach the "dish" to the structure and how to direct the light to the box, thinking like a parascope tube that gets directed to the salt batteries. 
	* Convenience/interface features; making it more "accessible" 
		* Haven't dealt with heat modulation or electrical controls 
	* Thinking about the cooktop as not one large rectangular burner but two circular burners (to prevent lots of heat loss)
		* Possible two burners ideally, but the practical outcome could just be one burner (focus on actually building something)
* Collection 
	* Fabrication would involve making the dish out of lots of curved segments, not fabricating one solid dish 
* Solar Tracking 
	* Photosensor approach to get the maximum amount of sunlight directed into the dish.
* Storage/Heat Transfer
	* Still the idea of the adjustable height fins 
	* Thinking about insulation of the salt batteries 

#### Midreview
<br>

* Want things 
	* Slides with everything that has been considered
	* As much prototyping as possible 
		* As well as mockups/CAD models, but the prototyping influences that 
		* Maybe some 3D printed models would be useful 
		* Scale figures (like showing people in the figure or something that gives some sort of scale)
		* 2D sketches would be nice, not necessarily trying to create many 3D models 
	* Effectiveness of the communication 
* Draft slide show for individual teams 
* Conform to a list of deliverables that will be made available
