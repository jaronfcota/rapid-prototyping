## Week 4
<br>
### Energy Storage Focus Group
<br>
#### Mechanical vs Electrical Energy Storage

* Essentially the capture and use of the energy will greatly determine the mode of energy storage 
* Need to note the scale of the project 
  * Paying attention to timescales 
    * Probably want something that is able to efficienty store energy quickly and efficiently expel the energy 
  * If it is more of an installation, the could have passive energy capture to continually add to an energy bank (like a thermal sort of storage)
    * And if the installation is bigger, then mechanical energy storage may be more feasible
      * Not entirely sure about the energy density of mechanical energy, like unsure how heavy a block is needed to power a lightbulb, say.
* Mechanical
  * Flywheel 
  * Stacked blocks
  * Compressed air
  * Would be good to keep things mechanical 
    * i.e. not storing energy mechanically and then converting it to electrical energy 
      * dependent upon the method of energy capture 
* Electrical
  * Capacitors maybe 
  * Batteries 
    * Also pretty good as an "energy bank" like described in the previous bullet points 
  * [Proton-exchange membrane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton-exchange_membrane#:~:text=A%20proton%2Dexchange%20membrane%2C%20or,to%20oxygen%20and%20hydrogen%20gas.) (reveresible water destruction and recombination) 
  * Hydrogen fuel cells 
  * Potential water purification 
* Thermal storage 
* And also would be good to keep things electrical if it makes sense to power something, like a motor or other electrical device to make the project work
