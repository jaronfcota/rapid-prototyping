## Week 4
<br>
### Energy Storage Focus Group
<br>
#### Mechanical vs Electrical Energy Storage

* Essentially the capture and use of the energy will greatly determine the mode of energy storage 
* Need to note the scale of the project 
  * Paying attention to timescales 
    * Probably want something that is able to efficienty store energy quickly and efficiently expel the energy 
  * If it is more of an installation, the could have passive energy capture to continually add to an energy bank (like a thermal sort of storage)
    * And if the installation is bigger, then mechanical energy storage may be more feasible
      * Not entirely sure about the energy density of mechanical energy, like unsure how heavy a block is needed to power a lightbulb, say.
* Mechanical
  * Flywheel 
  * Stacked blocks
  * Compressed air
  * Would be good to keep things mechanical 
    * i.e. not storing energy mechanically and then converting it to electrical energy 
      * dependent upon the method of energy capture 
* Electrical
  * Capacitors maybe 
    * Could be used to mediate the energy storage 
  * Batteries 
    * Also pretty good as an "energy bank" like described in the previous bullet points 
  * [Proton-exchange membrane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton-exchange_membrane#:~:text=A%20proton%2Dexchange%20membrane%2C%20or,to%20oxygen%20and%20hydrogen%20gas.) (reveresible water destruction and recombination) 
  * Hydrogen fuel cells 
  * Potential water purification 
* Thermal storage 
  * Molten salt energy storage 
* And also would be good to keep things electrical if it makes sense to power something, like a motor or other electrical device to make the project work 
* Also need to keep in mind when the energy will be collected 
  * Like mostly easier to collect energy during the day to supply something in the night 
* "Incidental" energy storage 
  * Like piezoelectric currents charging a battery
    * And maybe thousands and thousands or footsteps could result in some significant generation
    * High foot traffic flux 
  * Triboelectric effect 

### Energy Harvesting Brainstorming Thoughts
<br>

* Think if what you want to power on a person
  * Possibly like a phone or a watch or a bodycam
  * Power needs to span 6 orders of magnitude
* Possible ways of harvesting energy from a person
  * Motion (arms, legs, fingers, footfalls, etc)
  * Breating, body heat
  * Potentially scavengable power 
  * "Human-generated power for mobile electronics"
  * Good potential for low-power electronics 
  * Knee-flexing 
  * Backpack motion 
    * Maybe could have a modular attachment that charges a battery for phone charging 
  * Power/weight 

### Convergent Brainstorming 

Went through our initial brainstorming and eliminating the impractical ideas

* Thinking about a passively powered cooking device
  * Renewable cooking on demand 
  * Grill vs. hot water 
  * "mobile espresso" 
* Research questions 
  * Are there any examples of something like this already?
    * Renewable on-demand cooking, specifically 
    * Sun buckets company? 
    * Solar thermos? 
  * Which temp. ranges are useful? 
    * Ability to control temperature? 
  * What cooking techniques are available/useful?
    * Like a grill 
* Materials?
  * Water/antifreeze/solid/salt/wax 
  * Phase change materials 
  * Multiple energy storage mats for different temps

#### Materials/storage team 
* Firebricks potentially 
* What properties to focus on
  * High heat capacity
  * Conductivity somehow 
  * Flamability/toxicity 
  * Storage in the form of liquid or gas 

* Need good insulation 
* Phase change material, solid material, material with certain boiling point
