## Week 6
<br>
#### Systems Thinking for Climate and Sustainability Systems Presentation 

* Systems thinking 
  * SAFO Framework
    * System Architecture - what is it and how does it operate
      * Mechanics, hardware, software
      * structure (static) and behavior (dynamic)
    * System Function - what does the system do?
      * system interacting with environment
    * System Outcome - in what ways does the system function affect people?
      * What is the problem solved, the affected people, benefits, tradeoffs
      * expected and unexpected outcomes, positive and negative
* Systems presentations 
  * Systems integration team 
    * Benefit: emission free on-demand cooking 
      * Improve: electrical system, make things more user friendly 
    * Detriment: storage and high temperature ranges
      * Improve: change the storage material
  * Energy collection system 
    * Benefit: renewable energy source
      * Improve: lenses or reflectors 
    * Detriment: takes up a lot of space 
      * Improve: foldable, make aesthetically pleasing, multipurpose use of space 

### Salt batteries
Contains sodium nitrate (NaNO3) and potassium nitrate (KNO3). [Safety data sheets.](https://beta-static.fishersci.com/content/dam/fishersci/en_US/documents/programs/education/regulatory-documents/sds/chemicals/chemicals-s/S25558B.pdf)
6"x7"x11", 1/4 inch thick, around 85% salt it appears.

* Questions for the box 
  * full specs on the box and the steel used
  * how many times was it heated
  * why the leak 
  * why a hole drilled 
  * thermal expansion of the box/potential problems that they already encountered 
  * proportion/how much of the salt was put into the box 
  * who was it that designed the box 

* How to do the thermal transfer?
  * Direct conduction between the surface of the box and the cooking top 
    * Like the insulator/conductor drawing
  * Have a fluid be heated up and then move hot fluid to the cooking surface 
    * Like a heat pipe or a heat transfe fluid
    * Could add more control 
  * fins and complementary fins 
    * Change height of cooking surface to increase or decrease surface area and control the heat transfer 
    * Could provide a lot more surface area 
    * Maybe dovetails somehow 

#### Prototyping!
<br>
Next step is to probably create prototypes to test these systems. Useful things 
could be found via McMaster-Carr. 

#### Convection heat transfer idea 

* Specs 
  * Liquid
    * [Here are some heat transfer fluids](https://www.therminol.com/heat-transfer-fluids)
      * Might be a bit more industrial than what we need it for, but if one of these can work then they can work 
    * [An application for solar water heating systems](https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/solar-water-heaters/heat-transfer-fluids-solar-water-heating-systems)
    * [How To Pick the Right Heat Transfer Fluid](https://www.dow.com/content/dam/dcc/documents/en-us/tech-art/176/176-01616-01-how-to-choose-the-right-heat-transfer-fluid.pdf?iframe=true)
  * Pump 
    * [Heat transfer pump for concentrated solar power](https://www.sulzer.com/en/shared/applications/heat-transfer-fluid-pump-for-concentrated-solar-power)
    * [CHOOSING THE PROPER PUMP FOR YOUR HEAT TRANSFER SYSTEM](https://durathermfluids.com/choosing-proper-pump-heat-transfer-system/)
    * Centrifugal pump 
  * Heat transfer putty 
    * 'Heat Conductive Putty is used to fill voids between cable and pipe surfaces; to increase contact between pipes and heating cables in maximize heat conductivity.'
    * Can be bought 
  * Tubing 
    * [The Thermal Conductivity of Common Tubing Materials
    Applied in a Solar Water Heater Collector](http://ascpro0.ascweb.org/archives/cd/2010/paper/CPRT192002010.pdf)
  * Potential prototype heating surface
