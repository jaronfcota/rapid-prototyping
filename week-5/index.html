## Week 5
<br> 
### Energy Storage Focus Group

* Sensible heat storage; storing energy by heating something up
* Interest in latent heat storage; essentially storing heat in the form of a phase change 
  * Anhydrous salts
    * Adding water is an exothermic reaction 
  * Molten salts 
* Chemical heat storage 

* Multiple energy storage media?
  * Either multiple different salts or sensible mixed with latent heat storage 
    * And if it turns out that using excess heat to charge batteries is useful then that is also an option 

* Variables and Criteria
  * Temperature of the phase change
  * The quality of the insulation 
  * Cost
  * Availability
  * Safety
  * Corrosiveness/Containment/degradation 
  * Lifetime and disposal
  * Energy density 
  * Method of heat transfer 
  * What to do with a "charged battery" 

* Dependent upon types of cooking - maybe utilizing multiple types of cooking 
  * Flat top 
  * Grill 
    * Possibility to use hot air to cook the food 
    * Maybe have a sliding grill type thing to limit conduction and control 
  * Hot air percolation?
  * Air-frying 

* Most likely options:
  *
