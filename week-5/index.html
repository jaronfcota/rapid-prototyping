## Week 5
<br> 
### Energy Storage Focus Group

See [this google slide for the pinup presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1L8QO2hFe0YEIImoED_7eao3nOXle57VCv-ufpZuIcac/edit#slide=id.gf613ff932a_3_10)

* Sensible heat storage; storing energy by heating something up
* Interest in latent heat storage; essentially storing heat in the form of a phase change 
  * Anhydrous salts
    * Adding water is an exothermic reaction 
  * Molten salts 
* Chemical heat storage 

* Multiple energy storage media?
  * Either multiple different salts or sensible mixed with latent heat storage 
    * And if it turns out that using excess heat to charge batteries is useful then that is also an option 

* Variables and Criteria
  * Temperature of the phase change
  * The quality of the insulation 
  * Cost
  * Availability
  * Safety
  * Corrosiveness/Containment/degradation 
  * Lifetime and disposal
  * Energy density 
  * Method of heat transfer 
  * What to do with a "charged battery" 

* Dependent upon types of cooking - maybe utilizing multiple types of cooking 
  * Flat top 
  * Grill 
    * Possibility to use hot air to cook the food 
    * Maybe have a sliding grill type thing to limit conduction and control 
  * Hot air percolation?
  * Air-frying 

* Most likely options:
  * 

#### Cooking Team Presentation 
* Max temp 400-450F, min temp 100F
* Heat modulation
  * Quick transition from sear (400) to saute (200)
  * Areas with diff. temps. 
* Different foods need different temperatures
  * That means a large surface area is potentially needed 
* Additional features
  * Oven/grill lid
  * Metal racks
  * Overhead light 
  * Stirling generator to catch overflow heat and charge battery 
* R.I.C.K. (renewable independent cooking kitchen)
  * Maybe 5ft by 2ft cooking surface
